I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, Clemson University. I work with Dr. Paige Rodeghero at the Human Factors Software Engineering (HFSE) lab. My main research interests are _**onboarding software engineers**_, _**machine learning in software engineering**_, _**virtual reality in software engineering**_, and _**software engineering for autism**_.

I completed my M.S. in computer science from Clemson University in Aug 2019. Before starting my master's, I worked as an oracle EBS technical consultant.
